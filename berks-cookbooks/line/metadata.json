This cookbook supplies various \nresources that will help you do this.\n\n# Usage\nAdd \"depends 'line'\" to your cookbook's metadata.rb to gain access to\nthe resoures.\n\n    append_if_no_line \"make sure a line is in dangerfile\" do\n      path \"/tmp/dangerfile\"\n      line \"HI THERE I AM STRING\"\n    end\n    \n    replace_or_add \"spread the love\" do\n      path \"/some/file\"\n      pattern \"Why hello there.*\"\n      line \"Why hello there, you beautiful person, you.\"\n    end\n\n    delete_lines \"remove hash-comments from /some/file\" do\n      path \"/some/file\"\n      pattern \"^#.*\"\n    end\n\n    add_to_list \"add entry to a list\"\n      path \"/some/file\"\n      pattern \"People to call: \"\n      delim [\",\"]\n      entry \"Bobby\"\n    end\n\n\n# Notes\nSo far, the only resource implemented are \n\n    append_if_no_line\n    replace_or_add\n    delete_lines\n    add_to_list\n\n  add_to_list\n    delim must be an array of 1 or 2 muli-character elements.\n      If one delimiter is given, it is assumed that either the delimiter or the given search pattern will proceed each entry and\n      each entry will be followed by either the delimeter or a new line character:\n\t  delim [\",\"]\n          People to call: Joe, Bobby, Karen\n          People to call: Joe, Karen, Bobby\n          People to call: Bobby, Joe, Karen\n\t   \n      If two delimiters are given, they will suround each entry.
